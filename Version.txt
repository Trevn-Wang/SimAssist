V6.1
1. Short command add new feature: support keyboard arrow operation and ctrl/alt/shift to make it popmenu
2. Short command now support scope, mux/demux
3. Fix bug for adder_plus_minus and adder_multiply_divide
4. Add "datacompare" script to facilitate unit test during AG010 EMS development

V6.1.1
1. Minor Bug Fix in BlockGroup class
2. New feature added for Command line
    - $ABC to set major property
    - Block support: add Prelookup, Interpolation using prelookup, Gain, Abs
    - Mofify behavior of Lookup and Lookup2D creation, when given only one variable name, automatically append _X or _Y as axis name
    - If no match pattern in given command string, default behavior to create a Constant block (prefix with "cnst")


V6.2.0
1. !!!Big change on history mechanism, the previous set_param_and_appendhis was replaced by two newly designed SimAction and ActionRecord to faciliate usage
2. Add "magnetic", "color", "line2fg" feature in command line


V6.2.1
1. Add support for DataStoreRead/Write


V6.2.2
1. Automatically set Constant to boolean if set to "true", "false", "TRUE", "FALSE"
2. Type "?" in command line to query variable explanation from INCA


V6.2.3 2014-9-2
1. Optimize usage of from/goto command, if block or line selected, automatically connect the from/goto block with the selection
2. Add sizing command "shorter", "longer", "narrower", "wider", and associate with hotkey Alt + DirectionArrow
3. Add Motohawk/Simulink convert command "s2m", "m2s"


V6.2.4 2014-9-17
1. Optimize usage of inport/outport command, if block or line selected, automatically connect the inport/outport block with the selection
2. Allow customize annotation content as suffix after "anno" keyword
3. BusCreator allows "bc+2", "bc -2" pattern to add/reduce port numbers
4. BusSelector allows bsall to select all signals
5. "cnst" keyword automatically connect to empty inport when block selected

V6.2.5 2014-9-21
1. Optimize usage of "property assignment"
	- "$" or "\" is both valid as leading command identification
	- the number of "$" "\" repetation indicates the Nth property to be assigned
	- Order of property can be defined in configuration file simassist_majorprop_def.m
2. Optimize BusCreator usage, when "bc-" entered (without following number), any inports without line connection will be cleared
3. Add "=>" keyword that supports string replace of properties


V6.2.6 2014-10-08
1. Add support for direct data type setting of MotoHawk blocks
2. Support creating counterpart of DataStoreRead/Write when using propagation button in reverse (similar to From/Goto creation)
3. Command line: dsm/dsr/dsw, when DataStore block selected, create corresponding block for each selected one

V6.3.0
1. AutoLine function added with several assist handle to handle connection functions, hotkey Ctrl in command line
2. Command line: "color" when Constant block selected, color all the Constant blocks with same name under the same path
3. Command line: "clean" also cleans blocks that has no line connected, this is useful when trying to delete multiple blocks in cluster of lines and blocks
2. Other bug fix

V6.3.2
1. Add support for "CAN Unpack" block for signal propagation



#############################################################
V7.0
1. New architecture and object-oriented designed
2. Blocks and Macros are registered in seperate way and allows plug-in behavior

V7.0.3
1. Support stateflow scope dictionary rename
2. Support stateflow selection dictionary rename

V7.0.4
1. Refine layout blocks, use new designed neaten_line function to layout around block

V7.0.5 2015-04-24
1. Adjust some macro naming
2. Refine layout feature, NeatenLine function
3. Add TemporaryCurrentBlockBased function to handle the situation when infos like layout shall be retrieved from current block.
